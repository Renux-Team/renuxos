# **Future Plans for Renux OS**

Renux OS is in constant evolution, focusing on **security**, **performance**, and **modularity**. Below are the future plans for the operating system:

## 🚀 **Future Versions**
- **`Version 1.0 ("Aurora") <- Current(DEV)`**: Initial release for internal testing and community feedback.
- **`Version 2.0 ("Jaguar")`**: Public release with more features and enhanced stability.
- **Subsequent versions**: Alternating between **internal testing** and **public releases** to ensure continuous system evolution.

## 🔐 **Security**
- **Enhance the Kernel in Rust**: Implement additional security layers and memory control with Rust.
- **Add secure drivers**: Focus on driver security, transitioning from C to Zig for increased safety and efficiency.
- **Intelligent failure monitoring**: Develop an automated failure detection and recovery system.

## ⚡ **Performance**
- **Code and memory optimization**: Continue working on custom allocators to reduce memory fragmentation.
- **Modern driver in Zig**: Use Zig to create drivers that optimize performance while maintaining memory safety.
- **Faster and more efficient compilation**: Improve build processes using Cargo and Zig to reduce build time and enhance modularity.

## 🛠️ **Infrastructure and Tools**
- **Menuconfig**: Develop a separate configuration system for Renux OS, similar to Linux's `menuconfig`, but independent of the operating system.
- **Zig Bootloader**: Create a more efficient and customized bootloader using Zig to improve boot time and hardware detection.
- **Intelligent update system**: Develop an automated update system for drivers and the kernel, facilitating continuous updates without the need to rebuild the entire system.

## 🔄 **Language Integration**
- **Zig, Rust, C, and C++ in the system**: Continue integrating these languages effectively, leveraging the strengths of each:
  - **Rust** for the Kernel and secure memory management.
  - **Zig** for modern drivers, cross-compilation, and low-level optimizations.
  - **C/C++** for legacy hardware drivers and compatibility.

## 🌍 **Expansion and Contributions**
- **Open-source ecosystem**: Continue the evolution of Renux OS as an open-source project, encouraging contributions from developers and building a strong community.
- **Partnerships and collaborations**: Explore opportunities to collaborate with other operating system communities and open-source projects to share ideas and improve Renux OS.

## 💡 **Long-Term Goals**
- **Develop a modular architecture** that allows for fast and secure updates.
- **Expand compatibility** with various architectures and devices, including embedded systems and low-power devices.
- **Focus on continuous innovation**, surpassing traditional operating systems with **enhanced security**, **exceptional performance**, and **optimized user experience**.

## 🚀 **Conclusion**
Renux OS is designed to be a **modern, efficient, and secure** operating system. The integration of languages like Rust, Zig, C, and C++ offers incredible flexibility, while the focus on **security** and **performance** ensures that the system will become a **reference for the future of operating systems**.
