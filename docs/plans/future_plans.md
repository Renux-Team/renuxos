# Future of Renux OS


# Codenames
## Renux Aurora 1.0 <- Current
*"Renan Lucas(creator): I believe this will be a good start for my operating system because it will be an internal test but it is becoming very stable and very mature."* 
## Renux Jaguar 2.0
This will be a more mature and more "public" stage and has excellent quality drivers.
