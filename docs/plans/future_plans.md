# Future Plans for Renux OS 🚀

## Versions and Releases 🛠️

- **'Aurora' Version**: Release for **internal testing**.
- **'Jaguar' Version**: The next version will be **public**, available to a wider audience.
- The plan is to **alternate between internal and public releases** with each new version.

## Kernel Development and Improvements 🖥️

- **Hybrid Kernel**: Continue to enhance **Renux OS** with a strong hybrid kernel.
- **Drivers**: Develop drivers in **C** for legacy hardware and explore **Zig** and **C++** for modern drivers.
- **Driver Quality**: Aim to match the **quality** of NVIDIA drivers, maintaining clean, efficient code.

## Build System 🔧

- Use **Cargo** as the build system to streamline integration and system builds.
- Organize the code into specific **workspaces** for the kernel, menuconfig, and other modules, as planned:
  - `main`: For building the entire system.
  - `renux_kernel`: For kernel development.
  - `menuconfig`: For the configuration application.

## Independent Menuconfig 🎮

- Create **menuconfig** as a **separate** and **independent** application from Renux OS, but still assisting in system configuration.

## Exploration of New Technologies 🔬

- **Zig**: Integrate **Zig** into the project to expand development options.
- **Clang**: Use **Clang** as the default compiler to ensure fast and optimized builds.
- **Exploring Higher Dimensions**: Study and explore how **perception of higher dimensions** may become a reality in the future, through biology rather than just technology.

## Community Focus 🌍

- Continue to **alternate between internal and public releases**, gathering **feedback** continuously from the developer and tester community.
- Improve documentation and support to make it easier for other developers to **contribute** to the project.

## Future Vision 🚀

- Make **Renux OS** a leading operating system for those who seek **complete control**, focusing on security, performance, and freedom in development.
